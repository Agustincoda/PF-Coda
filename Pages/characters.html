           thus giving life to the flower.<br> Flowey on the surface has an up beat attitude and a smile but he can't feel anything 
           because he has no soul, so his real self is just evil without any care for anyone or anything other than himself.

           and she offered all them to live together, but all refused and went to face the king Asgore where they met their fate.
           <br>
           In the recent years Toriel went to the exit of the ruins where she has conversations with an unknow monster, mostly to tell jokes
           to each other. During one of this talks she made the unknow monster promise to help the next human that gets out of the ruins

        <div class="charcterDescription">
         <p>
           Sans the skeleton is a resident in Snowdin that lives with his brother Papyrus. He is a guy that likes
           to relax and do nothing as much as he can, but he also likes to tell jokes a lot. Sans joined the royal guard
           because his brother wanted to be part of them, and he didn't want to left his Papyrus with that kind of job alone (even though he doesn't like to work).
           <br>
           Sans gets around with all the monsters in Snowdin and seems to be on good terms with the royal scientist Alphys and the
           head of the royal guard Undyne.
         </p>
            <div class="imgAndText">

           to go up the ranks so that all can know his name and be friends with everyone. He lives with his older brother Sans
           in the town of Snowdin and although he loves his brother he can't stand his laziness and all of his puns.
           <br>
           Papyrus is an innocent soul that likes spaghetti and make puzzles but his number one objective is to
           capture a human.

           Waterfall near the house of Napstablook.
           <br>
           All this responsibility makes it seem that Undyne only has place in her life for battle and war, but she
           has a kind soul and worries for the lives of everyone. She is friends with Sans and Papyrus and the latter often
           goes to her house to cook and train.

         falls into the underground. His wife Toriel abandon him and considers him a monster beacuse of what he wants
         to do to the humans in the surface.

         He is the mentor of Undyne and is the superior of doctor Alphys but is in friendly terms with both of them.

         to Charas village and bury it in there. When Asriel arrived, the humans attacked him but he refused to
         fight back even though Chara's soul wanted to kill the humans. Being fataly wounded, Asriel returned to the underground

         The first human that fell in the underground after the barrier was cast. They are not fond of humans but 
         we don't know why. we know that living with Asriel and his parents wasn't enough to let that hatred die. So
         they made a plan were they would kill themselves and make Asriel absorb their soul. All of this so Asriel could
         cross the barrier and exterminate the humans. But they didn't count that Asriel wouldn't fight back and so the plan
         had failed.
         <br>
         Their souls disappeared and only needed someone with enough determination so Chara could come back again.
